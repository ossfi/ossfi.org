# Open-Source Supported Financial Information

## Our Goal

We're working to provide useful financial information to everyone for free using open-source software and the open-source data model where members of the community who have specific knowledge of the financial markets can contribute their data aswell as advice.

We believe that financial information is a valuable resource for anyone and that it should be available to everyone. We started this project in 2021 and plan on continuing to develop and improve the financial information we provide aswell as our methods and tools.

## Some more information on our goal.

We are not affiliated with any financial institution. We also rely entirely on the financial data provided by [Open-Source Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence). We are not trying to be a financial advisor or offer financial advice, however we simply provide a place to share information about financial markets, companies & processes. This is so we can document the financial tools used by the financial industry and the financial markets themselves to try and help people understand the financial world aswell as shine a light on some more obscure, obfuscated, and often difficult to understand financial processes. We will also not hide from sharing details and explanations of potentially fraudulent financial processes, actors & companies, or financial markets.

Due to this it's up to other members of the community to keep this information current and accurate, it's up to you to use common sense when you use this information in any financial decisions.
